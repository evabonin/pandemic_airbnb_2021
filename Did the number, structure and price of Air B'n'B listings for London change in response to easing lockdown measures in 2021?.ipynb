    "Stricter lockdown measures may affect host and guest behaviour. In particular, it may affect\n",
    "- The number of listings (hypothesis: fewer)\n",
    "- The type of listings (hypothesis: increase in prpoportion of listings offering whole place vs shared)\n",
    "- The price (hypothesis: increase in price to reflect additional cleaning and security costs)\n",

    "# Method\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Comparison of number of listings, type of listing and price of listing [does price need to be adjusted for something, e.g. price per person?] for January - June 2021 [could do for a longer period but starting with this].\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "- Categorising lockdown measures into \"milder\" and \"stronger\" based on whether they are easing or tightening [based on graph referenced above].\n",
    "(- Summary statistics: counts, means, medians, measures of dispersion) [less interested in this so doing this later - but good to do for sense check etc.]\n",
    "- Graphs: plotting stats against level of restrictions [still thinking about the best way of doing this]\n",
